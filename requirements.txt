# Student RAG Tutorial - Python Dependencies
# ========================================
# 
# This project is designed to use ONLY Python standard library
# to keep it simple and educational for students.
#
# Current dependencies: NONE! 🎉
# 
# The project uses these built-in Python modules:
# - re (regular expressions)
# - math (mathematical functions) 
# - collections (Counter for word counting)
# - typing (type hints for better code documentation)
#
# Optional dependencies for future enhancements:
# ---------------------------------------------
# If you want to extend this project, consider these packages:
#
# numpy>=1.21.0              # For efficient vector operations
# scikit-learn>=1.0.0        # For advanced similarity metrics and ML
# matplotlib>=3.5.0          # For visualizing similarity scores
# pandas>=1.3.0              # For handling larger document collections
# streamlit>=1.0.0           # For creating a web interface
# jupyter>=1.0.0             # For creating interactive notebooks
# nltk>=3.7                  # For advanced text processing
# spacy>=3.4.0               # For more sophisticated NLP
#
# Installation commands for optional packages:
# pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib pandas
# pip install streamlit jupyter nltk spacy
#
# But remember: this tutorial works perfectly with just Python! 🐍
